# PowerIK Fix for Unreal Engine 5.6

I fixed some compile issues for the PowerIK plugin when migrating my project.  
This fix is uploaded to save time for anyone facing the same problem.

Thanks to PowerIK for providing the most affordable solution for foot IK.

## Note  
Unreal Engine 5 provides a more elegant ControlRig solution for this, but it requires a bit of Blueprint programming, unfortunately.

## How to Use  
If you encounter the same issue, simply copy this repository to your `[project_name]/Plugins/PowerIK`.

> **Important:** This fix has only been tested on the Node in AnimGraph.  
> The ControlRig PowerIK node **has not** been tested.
